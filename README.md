In this project we analyze a sample of 21 bright Be stars in the northern hemisphere of the Milky Way. We measure the intensities of key emission
lines in the L band (2.9–4.1 μm; Brα, Pfγ, Hu14) using IRAF on spectra taken with the 2.1 m telescope at the OAN/UNAM San Pedro Mártir
Observatory. From these measurements we build the Lenorzer diagram to classify the circumstellar discs by their optical depth and to identify
whether they are in build-up, dissipation, or nearly steady-state phases. 

To link the observed spectra with the physical structure of the discs, we fit the data with a viscous decretion disc (VDD) model with a locally
isothermal gas and a power-law density profile, using Bayesian inference and MCMC sampling to estimate the disc parameters and their uncertainties.
The results show that the VDD model reproduces almost steady-state discs reasonably well, but also reveals discrepancies in parameters such as the
density exponent and stellar mass, suggesting that further refinements of the model are needed.
